Overview
Baby Name Explorer is a C++ program that loads over a 100,00+ baby name records from the US Social Security Administration dataset and allows users to:
- Search how popular a name is
- Compare two names
- View the Top 10 names in a given year
- Compare Hash Table vs Trie performance

This project uses two custom data structures:
- A manually implemented Hash Table
- A manually implemented Trie
